- Add a traffic monitor to monitor remote SSH traffic
- On windows clients, launch the SSH process using a `cmd` shell instead of powershell

## v1.0.24
- Add support for using an interactive terminal when establishing the SSH connection via the setting `remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal`.

- Add `code` and `cursor` to the `PATH` in the remote environment
- Forward ports for both `IPv4` and `IPv6`, and open ports on `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` locally

## v1.0.21
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Fix stability with SSH agent forwarding.
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Improve performance of remote server downloads.

## v1.0.20
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Prefer using `/tmp` for temporary files if `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set but not writable.

## v1.0.19
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Increase the timeout to 90 seconds for checking the remote server ports

## v1.0.18
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Move the log, token, and pid files to `/tmp` to eliminate issues when the server installation directory is on a slow disk
- Add the setting `remote.SSH.enableRemoteCommand`
- Add support for FreeBSD

## v1.0.17
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Continue with establishing the connection even if the multiplex server fails to start. This feature is only required for Docker over SSH.

## v1.0.16
- Add config option `remote.SSH.serverShutdownTimeout` to change the default server shutdown timeout, after which the remote server will terminate due to inactivity. Default is 5 minutes (300 seconds). This setting requires Cursor 1.2 or greater.

## v1.0.15
- (Linux Clients) Explicitly unset 'ARGV0' when launching the SSH command to fix an issue with multiple jump hosts

## v1.0.14
- Refactor the reconnection logic to attempt to reuse existing SSH connections or socks connections, instead of always creating new ones.
- (Windows Remotes) Run Powershell with `-NoProfile`

## v1.0.13
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Configured the installation script to run in a non-login shell

## v1.0.12
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Fix a newline encoding issue that prevented the server from starting

## v1.0.11
- (macOS / Linux Clients): Always use a shell to launch the SSH client, and pass the command over stdin. Fixes issues where some hosts reject or truncate long command strings.
- Copy files over SSH instead instead of SCP

## v1.0.10
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Fix an issue where the install script was running in a login shell, inheriting all bash options
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Fix an issue where logfiles and lockfiles were not properly versioned

## v1.0.9
- (Windows Remotes) Fixed an issue where the fallback to SCP on failed downloads was not automatic

## v1.0.8
- Add an explicit error message when trying to use VSCode remote containers with Anysphere Remote SSH, as they are incompatible with each other
- Fallback to SCP'ing the server when the remote server fails to download directly

## v1.0.7
- Fix a bug where the Docker over SSH connection would terminate automatically after 5 minutes

## v1.0.6
- Remove the "Select Remote Platform" prompt for initial connection attempts. The new flow assumes that the remote system is running Linux/macOS
  and will only prompt if the initial connection attempt failed
- Show progress on remote server downloads
- Reset the connection timeout so long as downloads are making progress.

## v1.0.5
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Automatically clear the lock file if it was left behind by a previous, failed connection attempt
- (macOS / Linux Remotes) Add a "Generate Connection Report" command to help diagnose connection issues
- (Windows clients) Replaced the SSH Askpass helper with a .bat script to resolve warnings from antivirus programs
- (Windows clients) Hide console host windows that appeared when using a SSH proxy or jump host


## v1.0.4
- Fix a bug, when using Remote Containers over SSH, spawned commands were not terminated when the window closed

## v1.0.3

## v1.0.0
- Simplified README

## v0.0.34

## v0.0.33
- Add support for cancelling connection attempts

## v0.0.31
- Fix an issue where the server fails to start on macOS remote hosts, due to a base64 decoding issue

- If the bundled NodeJS executable fails to run, fallback to using the system NodeJS executable (if available) and the system NodeJS version >= 20

## v0.0.29
- Increased default connection timeout to 180 seconds (up from 60 seconds)
- Fixed a race condition when starting the remote server, where it would fail to start on slow filesystems

  Now, all remote server artifacts respect this setting.
